# LNRS_HACKATHON_ASHMITLAL

This project provides an automated system for generating a wide range of diagrams based on user input. It leverages Flask for the web interface, Graphviz for generating visual diagrams, and spaCy for processing natural language inputs. Users can generate flowcharts, sequence diagrams, mind maps, UML diagrams, and more, simply by describing the process or workflow they want visualized. The project includes customization features that allow users to modify diagram colors, labels, and shapes for better personalization.
Shape Customization: Choose custom shapes (e.g., circles, diamonds, rectangles) for diagram nodes.
Label Customization: Add personalized labels to edges and nodes to provide more context to diagrams.
